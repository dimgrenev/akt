    Detect any interpolation issues in the font.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    When creating a variable font, the designer must make sure that corresponding paths have the same       
    start points across masters, as well as that corresponding component shapes are placed in the same      
    order within a glyph across masters. If this is not done, the glyph will not interpolate correctly.     
                                                                                                            
    Here we check for the presence of potential interpolation errors using the                              
    fontTools.varLib.interpolatable module.

    Result: WARN


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 0
    WARN: 1
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
