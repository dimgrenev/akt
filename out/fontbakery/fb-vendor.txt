    Checking OS/2 achVendID.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This list is updated          
    regularly and is indexed by a 4-char "Vendor ID" which is stored in the achVendID field of the OS/2     
    table.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                            
    Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some applications may display     
    the type designer / type foundry contact info on some dialog and also because that info will be         
    visible on Microsoft's website:                                                                         
                                                                                                            
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/                                                    
                                                                                                            
    This check verifies whether or not a given font's vendor ID is registered in that list or if it has     
    some of the default values used by the most common font editors.                                        
                                                                                                            
    Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs. If you registered        
    recently, you're safe to ignore warnings emitted by this check, since your ID will soon be included in  
    one of our upcoming releases.

    WARN OS/2 VendorID value 'NONE' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe    
         to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code,  
         and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx       
         [code: unknown]                                                                                    

    Result: WARN


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 0
    WARN: 1
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
