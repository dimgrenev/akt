    Check for codepoints not covered by METADATA subsets.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    This check ensures that all encoded glyphs in the font are covered by a subset declared in the          
    METADATA.pb. Google Fonts splits the font into a set of subset fonts based on the contents of the       
    `subsets` field and the subset definitions in the `glyphsets` repository.                               
                                                                                                            
    Any encoded glyphs which are not by any of these subset definitions will not be served in the           
    subsetted fonts, and so will be unreachable to the end user.

    WARN The following codepoints supported by the font are not covered by any subsets defined in the       
         font's metadata file, and will never be served. You can solve this by either manually adding       
         additional subset declarations to METADATA.pb, or by editing the glyphset definitions.

    Result: WARN


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 0
    WARN: 1
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
