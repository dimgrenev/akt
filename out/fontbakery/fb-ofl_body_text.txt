    Check OFL body text is correct.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    Check OFL body text is correct. Often users will accidently delete parts of the body text.

    Result: WARN


Total:

    WARN: 1
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
