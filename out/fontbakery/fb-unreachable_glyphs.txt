    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    Glyphs are either accessible directly through Unicode codepoints or through substitution rules.         
                                                                                                            
    In Color Fonts, glyphs are also referenced by the COLR table. And mathematical fonts also reference     
    glyphs via the MATH table.                                                                              
                                                                                                            
    Any glyphs not accessible by these means are redundant and serve only to increase the font's file       
    size.

    Result: WARN


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 0
    WARN: 1
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
