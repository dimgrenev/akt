 >> soft_dotted
    Ensure soft_dotted characters lose their dot when combined with marks that replace the dot.

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    An accent placed on characters with a "soft dot", like i or j, causes the dot to disappear. An          
    explicit dot above can be added where required. See "Diacritics on i and j" in Section 7.1, "Latin" in  
    The Unicode Standard.                                                                                   
                                                                                                            
    Characters with the Soft_Dotted property are listed in

    WARN The dot of soft dotted characters should disappear in other cases, for example: i̒ i⃰ i̦̒ i̦⃰ i̧̒ i̧⃰ j̒ j⃰ j̦̒  
         j̦⃰ j̧̒ j̧⃰ і̒ і⃰ і̦̒ і̦⃰ і̧̒ і̧⃰ ј̀ ј́ [code: soft-dotted]                                                          

    Result: WARN


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 0
    WARN: 1
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
