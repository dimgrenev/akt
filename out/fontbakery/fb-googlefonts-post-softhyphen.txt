    Validate size, and resolution of article images, and ensure article page has minimum length and includes
visual assets.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    The purpose of this check is to ensure images (either raster or vector files) are not excessively       
    large in filesize and resolution.                                                                       
                                                                                                            
    These constraints are loosely based on infrastructure limitations under default configurations.         
                                                                                                            
    It also ensures that the article page has a minimum length and includes at least one visual asset.

 >> googlefonts/metadata/unreachable_subsetting
    Check for codepoints not covered by METADATA subsets.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    This check ensures that all encoded glyphs in the font are covered by a subset declared in the          
    METADATA.pb. Google Fonts splits the font into a set of subset fonts based on the contents of the       
    `subsets` field and the subset definitions in the `glyphsets` repository.                               
                                                                                                            
    Any encoded glyphs which are not by any of these subset definitions will not be served in the           
    subsetted fonts, and so will be unreachable to the end user.

    WARN The following codepoints supported by the font are not covered by any subsets defined in the       
         font's metadata file, and will never be served. You can solve this by either manually adding       
         additional subset declarations to METADATA.pb, or by editing the glyphset definitions.

    This check uses a heuristic to determine which GF glyphsets a font supports. Then it checks the font    
    for correct shaping behaviour for all languages in those glyphsets.

    Are there any misaligned on-curve points?
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do not sit on, significant   
    boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced     
    baseline point. As well as the baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for  
    lowercase Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.                             
                                                                                                            
    Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may call for points in     
    locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to generate significant numbers of false         
    positives, it will pass if there are more than 100 reported misalignments.

    Checking OS/2 achVendID.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This list is updated          
    regularly and is indexed by a 4-char "Vendor ID" which is stored in the achVendID field of the OS/2     
    table.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                            
    Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some applications may display     
    the type designer / type foundry contact info on some dialog and also because that info will be         
    visible on Microsoft's website:                                                                         
                                                                                                            
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/                                                    
                                                                                                            
    This check verifies whether or not a given font's vendor ID is registered in that list or if it has     
    some of the default values used by the most common font editors.                                        
                                                                                                            
    Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs. If you registered        
    recently, you're safe to ignore warnings emitted by this check, since your ID will soon be included in  
    one of our upcoming releases.

    WARN OS/2 VendorID value 'DMGR' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe    
         to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code,  
         and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx       
         [code: unknown]                                                                                    

    Result: WARN


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 1
    WARN: 6
    INFO: 8
    SKIP: 89
    PASS: 132



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
