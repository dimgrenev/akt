    Check math signs have the same width.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    It is a common practice to have math signs sharing the same width (preferably the same width as         
    tabular figures accross the entire font family).                                                        
                                                                                                            
    This probably comes from the will to avoid additional tabular math signs knowing that their design can  
    easily share the same width.

    WARN The most common width is 600 among a set of 16 math glyphs. The following math glyphs have a       
         different width, though:                                                                           
                                                                                                            
         Width = 820: uni2ABE, propersuperset, uni2ABD, propersubset [code: width-outliers]                 

    Result: WARN


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 0
    WARN: 1
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
