    Ensure dotted circle glyph is present and can attach marks.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    The dotted circle character (U+25CC) is inserted by shaping engines before mark glyphs which do not     
    have an associated base, especially in the context of broken syllabic clusters.                         
                                                                                                            
    For fonts containing combining marks, it is recommended that the dotted circle character be included    
    so that these isolated marks can be displayed properly; for fonts supporting complex scripts, this      
    should be considered mandatory.                                                                         
                                                                                                            
    Additionally, when a dotted circle glyph is present, it should be able to display all marks correctly,  
    meaning that it should contain anchors for all attaching marks.                                         
                                                                                                            
    A fontmake filter can be used to automatically add a dotted_circle to a font:                           
                                                                                                            
    fontmake --filter 'DottedCircleFilter(pre=True)' --filter '...'

    FAIL The following glyphs could not be attached to the dotted circle glyph:                             
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            
          - uni0328 [code: unattached-dotted-circle-marks]                                                  
                                                                                                            

    Result: FAIL


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 1
    WARN: 0
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
