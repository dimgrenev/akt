    Validate size, and resolution of article images, and ensure article page has minimum length and includes
visual assets.
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:                                                                
                                                                                                            
    The purpose of this check is to ensure images (either raster or vector files) are not excessively       
    large in filesize and resolution.                                                                       
                                                                                                            
    These constraints are loosely based on infrastructure limitations under default configurations.         
                                                                                                            
    It also ensures that the article page has a minimum length and includes at least one visual asset.

    WARN Family metadata at fonts/variable does not have an article. [code: lacks-article]                  

    Result: WARN


Total:
    ERROR: 0
    FATAL: 0
    FAIL: 0
    WARN: 1
    INFO: 0
    SKIP: 0
    PASS: 0



    Meaning of check results:

    An ERROR is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    A  WARN is something that you should consider addressing.
    An INFO result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when the check does not apply to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at
    https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or feature requests are also always welcome, of course!)
