    Are there any 
misaligned on-curve 
points?
    with Akt.ttf

    Rationale:           
                         
    This check           
    heuristically looks  
    for on-curve points  
    which are close to,  
    but do not sit on,   
    significant          
    boundary             
    coordinates. For     
    example, a point     
    which has a          
    Y-coordinate of 1    
    or -1 might be a     
    misplaced baseline   
    point. As well as    
    the baseline, here   
    we also check for    
    points near the      
    x-height (but only   
    for lowercase Latin  
    letters),            
    cap-height,          
    ascender and         
    descender Y          
    coordinates.         
                         
    Not all such         
    misaligned curve     
    points are a         
    mistake, and         
    sometimes the        
    design may call for  
    points in locations  
    near the             
    boundaries. As this  
    check is liable to   
    generate             
    significant numbers  
    of false positives,  
    it will pass if      
    there are more than  
    100 reported         
    misalignments.

    Meaning of check 
results:

    An ERROR is something
wrong with FontBakery 
itself, possibly a bug.
    A  FATAL is an 
extremely severe issue 
that must be addressed 
immediately.
    A  FAIL is a problem 
with the font that must 
be fixed.
    A  WARN is something 
that you should consider 
addressing.
    An INFO result simply
prints something useful. 
Typically stats.
    A  PASS means the 
font looks good for the 
given checking routine.
And a  SKIP happens when 
the check does not apply 
to the given font.

    If you get ERRORs, 
please help us improve 
the tool by reporting 
them at
    https://github.com/fo
nttools/fontbakery/issues
 (but other kinds of bug
    reports and/or 
feature requests are also
always welcome, of 
course!)



DEPRECATION WARNING:
By late-December 2024, 
FontBakery version 0.13.0

an automatic 
backwards-compatibility 
translation for you.
This automatic 
translation will be 
deprecated in the next 
major release.

Please start using the 
new check-IDs as 
documented at
