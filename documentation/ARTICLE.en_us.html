  <h1>Akt — a powerful typeface for modern user needs</h1>
  <p><strong>Unified glyphs width</strong> across all weights (Thin → Black) helps keep line lengths and UI element widths predictable when adjusting text weight. It also aids dark-theme tuning: step one weight lighter to balance contrast.</p>
  <p><strong>Capitals</strong> are vertically <strong>centered within the line height</strong> for harmonious alignment with icons. <strong>Terminals</strong> are horizontally <strong>calibrated</strong> for visual consistency.</p>
  <p>Over <strong>1,200 glyphs</strong> with support for <strong>400+ languages</strong> across <strong>Extended Latin</strong> and <strong>Cyrillic</strong>. There are <strong>7 font weights</strong> available (Thin → Bold ready; ExtraBold and Black are in progress). Designed by Dima Grenev.</p>
